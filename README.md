C++ program is designed to generate a division table based on a user-defined size and write the results to a file named results.dat. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program works and its functionality:

Code Breakdown
User Input:

The program prompts the user to enter the size of the division table (size).
File Handling:

An output file named results.dat is opened to write the generated division table.
The program checks if the file was opened successfully. If not, it prints an error message and returns with an error code.
Input Validation:

If the user enters a negative number, the program writes a message indicating that negative numbers are not allowed and exits.
If the user enters zero, it simply writes a header for the division table and exits.
Table Header:

If the size is valid (greater than zero), the program generates the table's header, which includes numbers from 1 to size aligned under a divider.
Divider Line:

A line of dashes is printed to separate the header from the division results.
Division Values:

A nested loop is used to calculate and print the division results. For each value of i (from 1 to size), it divides i by j (also from 1 to size) and formats the output to two decimal places.
Closing the File:

Finally, the file is closed after all the data has been written.
